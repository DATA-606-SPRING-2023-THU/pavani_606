# Project Title : House Price Prediction Analysis
# Project Overview
- Real estate is a crucial sector of the economy.
- Prices of real estate properties such as houses are liked to various factors such as population growth, unemployment, GDP and GNI.
- Accurately estimating the price of houses is essential for a variety of purposes, including buying, selling, investing, and financing.
# Objective
- The objective of this project is to 
- To apply data preprocessing and preparation techniques in order to obtain clean data.
- To build machine learning models able to predict house price based on house features
- To analyze and compare models performance in order to choose the best model
# Agenda
- Understanding of dataset and features.
- Data preparation, cleaning, and outlier analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis and insight generation.
- Feature selection and machine learning modelling.
# Technologies Used
- programming language : Python, react/streamlit (yet to decide on front-end framework)
- libraries : Pandas, Plotly, sklearn, scipy
- algorithms : Regression based algorithms used such as LogisticRegression, RandomForest, DecisionTree
# Repository Structure
- data : directory for datasets.
